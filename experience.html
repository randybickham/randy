            <p>I have never served in public office before, so don't have much experience here.  But I've lived in Indianola for more than 16 years, and with my wife raised our seven children here.</p>
                <p>In the business world I have more that 25 years working in the computer industry and several more years working in manufacturing, food service, and retail. </p>
            <p>While raising children, I worked my way through college by waiting tables, retail sales, and on a manufacturing line. Fortunately, I was able to graduate with Bachelor of Arts degree before our seventh child was born. The Master's degree came many years later.</p>
            <p>Working hard and constantly watching expenses has helped me throughout the rest of life</p>
            <P>While I currently manage several computer development teams and the projects they work on, I've held a lot of IT roles.  I was a programmer for many years with short times as a data anaylst and EDI developer.</P>
            <p>I know how to work with people, manage budgets, keep projects on track, and deal with all of the red tape and other issues that always appear.</p>
            <p>I bring fresh ideas, a strong work ethic, and high values to the city council.</p>
