            <p>Celeste and I moved to Indianola a little over 16 years ago. And it's been a great move for our family.</p>
            <p>We brought our seven children and enrolled them in the Indianola schools where they participated in band, orchestra, and many sports. Over the years, we've had a lot of team dinners in our home.</p>
            <p>We moved into a new phase of life as grandparents as the first of our grandchildren was born just over 5 years ago.  We have two more grandchildren coming this year bringing us to 15 grandkids.</p>
            <p>I work with General Dynamics IT working with the Veteran's Administration.  I manage several IT teams providing services to the many veterans and their families.  It's been a great experience.</p>
            <p>I do a lot of running, biking, and nordic skiing.  You've possibly seen me riding a unicycle around town.</p>
            <p>We've enjoyed a lot of activities as my family has grown. Some of those activities have included canoeing, biking, and traveling.  We been able to see 48 of the 50 states as a family as we drove in the family suburban and camped along the way.</p>
