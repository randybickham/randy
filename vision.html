            <p><b>Communicaation</b> - It's important for the council and the city to be open about what is happening.  With that we need to look to new ways to communicate what has been happening. Over the past year, I've discovered that Ryan Waller has a week email that is sent out with information about what's happened over the past week.  It's been great to get that email, and it's avaiable for anyone to receive. We need to be looking at better ways to get this information out there.</p>
            <p><b>Growth</b> - Indianola needs to continue to grow.  As a community we don't want to stagnate but we also want to make certain that the growth is at a pace the city can handle.</p>
            <p><b>Infrastructure</b> - parts of the city's infrastructure are very old (some sections are over 100 years old). We need to update these areas, but need to be able upgrade in a controlled manner.  As we grow as a city, we need to keep this infrastructure in sync with the growth.</p>
            <p><b>Controlling costs</b> - with all of the projects that we have going on, we don't want to increase taxes or create unneeded debt. We need to make certain that the money the city has available is spent in the most productive manner possible.</p>
